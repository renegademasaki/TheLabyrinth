# The Labyrinth game Readme

***NOTE*** - You may need to run **'pip install rich'** in the shell or terminal to get the game to work.

**User Story** - 
I want to test all the game's commands and run through the entire game automatically.
If anything doesn't work, I want the console to print a line saying where the test went wrong.

**Test Case** - 
Enter command "qa_solve_all".

**Expected result** - Automation script will run through entire game,
testing all commands and solving all puzzles.
If all tests run correctly, the "win game" message should print, and the game should exit.
